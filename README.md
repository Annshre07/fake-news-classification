# Fake News Classification using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes

## Overview
This project implements a fake news detection system using classical
natural language processing techniques.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a labeled fake news dataset containing article
titles and body text.

## Methodology
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classification

## Results
Accuracy achieved: 87.4%

## Conclusion
The model provides a strong, interpretable baseline for fake news detection
using traditional machine learning approaches.
